### About Me
<p> Hello! My name is Mike Guadagni and I am currently working at General Dynamics Electric Boat as a Mechanical Engineer. In addition, I am taking classes at CareerDevs, a software engineering development program. I am a quick learner and a great problem-solver. Eventually, I would love to follow my passion in life and become a developer. </p>

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Using Java to work with API's and MySQL databases. On the side, I am actively completing algorithms within Java, Javascript, and Python. 

### âš¡Besides coding, I enjoy...
- Staying active and being outside. I like to go to the gym, or play sports like basketball with my friends. In addition, I enjoy fishing as a relaxing pastime.
